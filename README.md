The main purpose of this project is 
- gain insight from sales data (trends and consumer behavior)
- make insights to understand the different factors that affect sales in different branches of the store.

The dataset was obtained from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition.


Approach: 
1) Structuring data from raw form into a desired format
- This included building a database, creating a table and inserting data, and making sure no tables contained null values.

2) Adding new columns to differentiate sales in the morning, afternoon, and evening; extracting days of the week; and months of the year

3) Answering various exploratory data analytical questions (commented in code)


Generic Questions: 
How many unique cities does the data have?
In which city is each branch
