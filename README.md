Generic Questions: 
How many unique cities does the data have?
In which city is each branch?

The main purpose of this project is 
- gain insight from sales data (trends and consumer behavior)
- make insights to understand the different factors that affect sales in different branches of the store.

The dataset was obtained from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition.

Approach: 
1) Structuring data from raw form into a desired format
- This included building a database, creating a table and inserting data, and making sure no tables contained null values.

2) Adding new columns to organize the data further
- Morning, afternoon, and evening
- Extracting days of the week
- Months of the year

4) Answering various exploratory data analytical questions (commented in code)
The SQL queries I used and the specific questions regarding the product, consumers, and sales are commented in my SQL file.









I completed two SQL certificates from Kaggle and wanted to apply these newly accquired skills through application. I referred to Zainib Mehmood's project guide I had found online in times I faced an issue.
